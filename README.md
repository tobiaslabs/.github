## Repository Naming Conventions

Here are some guidelines (largely taken from [UT Dallas](https://github.com/utdal/repository-naming)) on repository names that are descriptive and searchable:

- Repository names should use lower case letters only and be delimited by dashes.
- Err on the side of specificity. You may find you have to differentiate between similar ideas later, e.g. `purchase-rest-service` instead of `rest-service`.
- Be consistent with the Tobias Labs organization. Consider usage within the org, and think about how the repositories will be sorted and grouped.
- Prefer singular to plural, e.g. `thing` versus `things`.
- Use `script` as a prefix for repositories that are primarily to store scripting tools, e.g. `script-pre-publish-check`.
- Use `temp` as a prefix for repositories that are used for limited periods, e.g. `temp-aws-jupiter-proto`.
- Use `project` as a prefix for repositories meant for overall projects, e.g. `project-hunch`.
